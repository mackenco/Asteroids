Asteroids
=========

The classic arcade game Asteroids built for play in the browser using JavaScript, HTML5, and Canvas. 
 * Uses inheritance to build a MovingObject class which informs movement of the ship, asteroids, and bullets
 * Uses vector algebra to calculate movement of objects on the canvas
 * Checks for collisions of objects and removes them from the canvas if so. 
 * Checks when objects are out of bounds and updates them accordingly (bullets - removed from canvas, ship - reset to center, asteroids - appear on opposite side of canvas)
 * Has a custom background using a .jpg of space
